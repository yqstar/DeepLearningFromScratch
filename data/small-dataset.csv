I joined a new league this year and they have different scoring rules than I'm used to
It's a slight PPR league- .2 PPR
Standard besides 1 points for 15 yards receiving
2 points per completion, 6 points per TD thrown, and some bonuses for rec/rush/pass yardage
My question is, is it wildly clear that QB has the highest potential for points
I put in the rules at a ranking site and noticed that top QBs had 300 points more than the top RB/WR
Would it be dumb not to grab a QB in the first round
"In your scenario, a person could just not run the mandatory background check on the buyer and still sell the gun to the felon
There's no way to enforce it
An honest seller is going to not sell the gun to them when they see they're a felon on the background check
A dishonest seller isn't going to run the check in the first place
No one is going to be honest enough to run the check, see they're a felon, and then all of a sudden immediately turn dishonest and say ""nah, you know what, here's your gun anyway.""
They wouldn't run the fucking check in the first place, genius
Your bullshit proposal is NOT ENFORCEABLE
This is why people without
Here's an idea, why not make a background check system where it would be illegal to sell guns to felons
That doesn't convince you
We already fucking have that
What aren't you understanding about this
It's just currently not available to private sellers
I'd like to make it available, but there's no point in making it mandatory
You're just supporting it to make a gesture towards background check reform in bad faith
